//! # Immutable Data Structures for Rust
//!
//! This library implements several of the more commonly useful
//! immutable data structures for Rust. They rely on structural
//! sharing to keep most operations fast without needing to mutate the
//! underlying data store, leading to more predictable code without
//! necessarily sacrificing performance.
//!
//! Because Rust is not a garbage collected language, and immutable
//! data structures generally rely on some sort of garbage collection,
//! values inside these data structures are kept inside
//! [`Arc`][std::sync::Arc]s. Methods will generally accept either
//! owned values or [`Arc`][std::sync::Arc]s and perform conversion as
//! needed, but you'll have to expect to receive
//! [`Arc`][std::sync::Arc]s when iterating or performing lookup
//! operations. All caveats about using reference counted values apply
//! in general (eg. reference counting is simplistic and doesn't
//! detect loops).
//!
//! A design goal of this library is to make using immutable data
//! structures as easy as it is in higher level languages, but
//! obviously there's only so much you can do. Methods will generally
//! attempt to coerce argument values where they can: where an
//! [`Arc`][std::sync::Arc] is called for, it will be able to figure
//! out how to convert whatever is provided into an
//! [`Arc`][std::sync::Arc] if it isn't already.
//!
//! It's also been a design goal to provide as complete an API as
//! possible, which in a practical sense has meant going over the
//! equivalent implementations for Haskell to ensure the API covers
//! the same set of use cases. This obviously doesn't include things
//! like `Foldable` and `Functor` which aren't yet expressible in
//! Rust, but in these cases we've tried to make sure Rust iterators
//! are able to perform the same tasks.
//!
//! Care has been taken to use method names similar to those in Rust
//! over those used in the source material (largely Haskell) where
//! possible (eg. `Vector::new()` rather than `Vector::empty()`,
//! `HashMap::get()` rather than `HashMap::lookup()`). Where Rust
//! equivalents don't exist, terminology tends to follow Haskell where
//! the Haskell isn't too confusing, or, when it is, we provide more
//! readily understandable aliases (because we wouldn't want to
//! deprive the user of their enjoyment of the word
//! '[`snoc`][vector::Vector::snoc],' even though it's reportedly
//! not an obviously intuitive term).
//!
//! ## Why Immutable Data Structures
//!
//! Programming with immutable values, meaning that references to
//! values can be relied on to always point to the same value, means
//! that you can stop worrying about other parts of your code
//! tampering with a value you're working on unexpectedly, or from
//! unexpected parts of your code, making it a lot easier to keep
//! track of what your code is actually doing.
//!
//! Mutable values are, generally, a huge source of unexpected
//! behaviour that a lot of languages, like Haskell, Elm and Clojure,
//! have been designed to avoid altogether. Rust, being what it is,
//! does a good job of discouraging this kind of behaviour, and
//! keeping it strictly controlled when it's necessary, but the
//! standard library doesn't provide collection data structures which
//! are optimised for immutable operations. This means, for instance,
//! that if you want to add an item to a [`Vec`][std::vec::Vec]
//! without modifying it in place, you first need to
//! [`clone`][std::clone::Clone::clone] the whole thing before making
//! your change.
//!
//! Data structures exist which are designed to be able to make these
//! copies much cheaper, usually by sharing structure between them,
//! which, because this structure is also immutable, is both cheap and
//! safe. The most basic example of this kind of data structure is the
//! [`ConsList`][conslist::ConsList], where, if you have a list *L*
//! and you want to push an item *I* to the front of it, you'll get
//! back a new list which literally contains the data *'item I
//! followed by list L.'* This operation is extremely inexpensive, but
//! of course this also means that certain other operations which
//! would be inexpensive for a [`Vec`][std::vec::Vec] are much more
//! costly for a [`ConsList`][conslist::ConsList]â€”index lookup is an
//! example of this, where for a [`Vec`][std::vec::Vec] it's just a
//! matter of going to memory location *index times item size* inside
//! the [`Vec`][std::vec::Vec]'s memory buffer, but for a
//! [`ConsList`][conslist::ConsList] you'd have to walk through the
//! entire list from the start, following references through to other
//! list nodes, until you get to the right item.
//!
//! While all immutable data structures tend to be less efficient than
//! their mutable counterparts, when chosen carefully they can perform
//! just as well for the operations you need, and there are some, like
//! [`Vector`][vector::Vector] and [`HashMap`][hashmap::HashMap],
//! which have performance characteristics good enough for most
//! operations that you can safely choose them without worrying too
//! much about whether they're going to be the right choice for any
//! given use case. Better yet, most of them can even be safely
//! mutated in place when they aren't sharing any structure with other
//! instances, making them nearly as performant as their mutable
//! counterparts.
//!
//! ## Data Structures
//!
//! We'll attempt to provide a comprehensive guide to the available
//! data structures below.
//!
//! ### Performance Notes
//!
//! If you're not familiar with big O notation, here's a quick cheat
//! sheet:
//!
//! *O(1)* means an operation runs in constant time: it will take the
//! same time to complete regardless of the size of the data
//! structure.
//!
//! *O(n)* means an operation runs in linear time: if you double the
//! size of your data structure, the operation will take twice as long
//! to complete; if you quadruple the size, it will take four times as
//! long, etc.
//!
//! *O(log n)* means an operation runs in logarithmic time: for
//! *log<sub>2</sub>*, if you double the size of your data structure,
//! the operation will take one step longer to complete; if you
//! quadruple the size, it will need two steps more; and so on.
//! However, the data structures in this library generally run in
//! *log<sub>16</sub>* time, meaning you have to make your data
//! structure 16 times bigger to need one extra step, and 256 times
//! bigger to need two steps. This means that, while they still count
//! as O(log n), operations on all but really large data sets will run
//! at near enough to O(1) that you won't usually notice.
//!
//! *O(1)** means 'amortised O(1),' which means that an operation
//! usually runs in constant time but will occasionally be more
//! expensive, often O(n). Please note that this is not a common
//! notation; it's just a convention I've used in these docs to save
//! myself from having to type 'amortised' everywhere.
//!
//! ### Lists
//!
//! Lists are ordered sequences of single elements, usually with cheap
//! push/pop operations, and index lookup tends to be O(n). Lists are
//! for collections of items where you expect to iterate rather than
//! lookup.
//!
//! | Type | Constraints | Order | Push Front | Pop Front | Push Back | Pop Back | Append | Lookup |
//! | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//! | [`Vector<A>`][vector::Vector] | | insertion | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(n) | O(log n) |
//! | [`CatList<A>`][catlist::CatList] | | insertion | O(1) | O(1)* | O(1) | O(1)* | O(1) | O(n) |
//! | [`ConsList<A>`][conslist::ConsList] | | insertion | O(1) | O(1) | O(n) | O(n) | O(n) | O(n) |
//!
//! ### Maps
//!
//! Maps are mappings of keys to values, where the most common read
//! operation is to find the value associated with a given key. Maps
//! may or may not have a defined order. Any given key can only occur
//! once inside a map, and setting a key to a different value will
//! overwrite the previous value.
//!
//! | Type | Key Constraints | Order | Insert | Remove | Lookup |
//! | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//! | [`HashMap<K, V>`][hashmap::HashMap] | [`Hash`][std::hash::Hash] + [`Eq`][std::cmp::Eq] | undefined | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) |
//! | [`OrdMap<K, V>`][ordmap::OrdMap] | [`Ord`][std::cmp::Ord] | sorted | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) |
//!
//! ### Sets
//!
//! Sets are collections of unique values, and may or may not have a
//! defined order. Their crucial property is that any given value can
//! only exist once in a given set.
//!
//! | Type | Constraints | Order | Insert | Remove | Lookup |
//! | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//! | [`HashSet<A>`][hashset::HashSet] | [`Hash`][std::hash::Hash] + [`Eq`][std::cmp::Eq] | undefined | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) |
//! | [`OrdSet<A>`][ordset::OrdSet] | [`Ord`][std::cmp::Ord] | sorted | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) |
//!
//! ## In-place Mutation
//!
//! Most of these data structures support in-place copy-on-write
//! mutation, which means that if you're the sole user of a data
//! structure, you can update it in place with a huge performance
//! benefit (about an order of magnitude faster than immutable
//! operations, almost as fast as
//! [`std::collections`][std::collections]'s mutable data structures).
//!
//! Thanks to [`Arc`][std::sync::Arc]'s reference counting, we are
//! able to determine whether a node in a data structure is being
//! shared with other data structures, or whether it's safe to mutate
//! it in place. When it's shared, we'll automatically make a copy of
//! the node before modifying it, thus preserving the usual guarantees
//! you get from using an immutable data structure.
